# Coding-1-Final
 These are the starter files for S2021 Coding 1
For my Coding 1 final, I created a wedsite that includes information about me, some (fake) contact information, and some images of my favorite video games. On the homepage, there are three images. The first one is of a metroidvania game called Hollow Knight. Hollow Knight is a game about exploring a vast underground world as a nameless knight. The second image is of a rougelike game called Hades. In this game you play as Zagreus, the son of Hades. Zagreus was born in the underworld, and yearns to escape it. As you explore the underworld trying to get to the surface, you encounter many gods who are willing to aid your journey. The third image I added is of the game Splatoon 2. Splatoon 2 is a unique third person shooter with teams of four. You play as an inkling or an octoling, which can freely swap between a humanoid and squid/octopus form. You can hide in places as a squid/octoling that you normally wouldn't be able to.
